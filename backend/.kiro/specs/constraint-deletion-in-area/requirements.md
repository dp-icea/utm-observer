# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the `/constraints/delete-in-area` endpoint to allow deletion of airspace constraints within a specified geographical area. The endpoint should provide comprehensive error handling, validation, and proper integration with the existing hexagonal architecture. This functionality is critical for airspace management systems where constraints (no-fly zones, restrictions) need to be removed from specific areas.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an airspace manager, I want to delete all constraints within a specified geographical area, so that I can clear restrictions from a region when they are no longer needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DELETE request is made to `/constraints/delete-in-area` with valid coordinates THEN the system SHALL delete all constraints that intersect with the specified area
2. WHEN the deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL return a 200 OK response with details of deleted constraints
3. WHEN coordinates define a valid polygon THEN the system SHALL process the deletion request
4. WHEN the area contains multiple constraints THEN the system SHALL delete all matching constraints in a single operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive error handling for invalid requests, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid coordinates are provided THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with specific validation errors
2. WHEN coordinates form an invalid polygon (self-intersecting, less than 3 points) THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with polygon validation details
3. WHEN the area is too large (exceeds system limits) THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with area size limits
4. WHEN external service calls fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes (502 for DSS failures, 503 for USS failures)
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
6. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logging and monitoring of constraint deletions, so that I can track changes and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deletion request is processed THEN the system SHALL log the request details including coordinates and user context
2. WHEN constraints are successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL log the count and IDs of deleted constraints
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN external service calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request/response details for audit trails

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent response formats, so that I can reliably parse responses and handle different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the request is successful THEN the system SHALL return an ApiResponse with success message and deletion details
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return an ApiError with appropriate HTTP status codes and error details
3. WHEN no constraints are found in the area THEN the system SHALL return a 200 OK with a message indicating no constraints were deleted
4. WHEN partial failures occur THEN the system SHALL return details of both successful and failed deletions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the implementation to follow the existing hexagonal architecture patterns, so that the code is maintainable and consistent with the rest of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL use the existing ConstraintManagementUseCase pattern
2. WHEN making external calls THEN the system SHALL use the existing adapter pattern (DSS and USS adapters)
3. WHEN handling domain logic THEN the system SHALL use appropriate domain entities and value objects
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL follow the existing dependency injection patterns
